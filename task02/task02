Assignment for week 2:

- Use github.
- Create a Matlab code that solves mass-spring-damper system.
- Compare exact solution for free and damped vibrations with different ODE solvers.
- Reduce the error in position by adjusting solver settings.
- Analyze forced and slightly damped vibrations with time-varying harmonic force.
What happens when force frequency passes through damped natural frequency of the system?
How does the rate of change of the frequency affect the solution?
