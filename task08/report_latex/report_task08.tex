\section*{Introduction}
This is a report for the eighth assignment of the course \textit{Computational Methods in Mechanics}, concerning dynamic analysis. The assignment consists of five tasks, which are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
	\item To expand the previously-made general purpose program with dynamic analysis.
	\item To allow the program to automatically select the appropriate type of analysis.
	\item To solve a four-bar linkage using the program.
	\item To test different values for Baumgarte stabilization parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
	\item To compare results with an MBD package (e.g.~MSC ADAMS).
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Methods}
A diagram of the system under investigation is presented in Figure~\ref*{fig:system}. Masses of the bodies were determined to be directly proportional to length: $m_1 = m$, $m_2 = 2m$, $m_3 = m \sqrt{2}$.

	\caption{Diagram of the four-bar system.\label{fig:system}}
\end{figure}

To complete task 2, the function \texttt{analyse} was written. This function automatically determines the required type of analysis by checking the system's degrees of freedom and calls the appropriate function. If DOF $=$ 0, the function \texttt{run\_kinematics} is called for kinematic analysis, and if DOF $>$ 0, dynamic analysis is performed using the newly-written function \texttt{run\_dynamics}.


\section*{Results}
The system's dynamic behavior under gravity load was solved within the time span $t = 0 \dots 5$ s, with an output step size of $\Delta t = 0.01$ s. The system's physical parameters were defined as $m = 1$ kg and $L = 1$ m. Several different values for Baumgarte parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ were tested, and a comparison of the resulting values of constraint drift is presented in Figure~\ref*{fig:constraintdrift}. Reference results were computed using MSC ADAMS, employing identical time settings. The difference between the result sets is illustrated in Figure~\ref*{fig:comparison}.

\section*{Analysis}
Examining Figure~\ref*{fig:constraintdrift}, we can see that $\alpha = \beta = 0$ leads to an unacceptable (and growing) amount of drift. The drift is reduced when $\alpha = \beta = 1$, but the maximum value is still high. In general, we can see that greater parameter values lead to smaller amounts of constraint violation, which corresponds to the expected behavior.\\

When comparing results computed using the self-written program and ADAMS (Figure~\ref*{fig:comparison}), the difference in response is found to be ...
