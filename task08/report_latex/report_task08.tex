\section*{COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN MECHANICS: Assignment 8}

\section*{Introduction}
This is a report for the eighth assignment of the course \textit{Computational Methods in Mechanics}, concerning dynamic analysis. The assignment consists of five tasks, which are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
	\item To expand the previously-made general purpose program with dynamic analysis.
	\item To allow the program to automatically select the appropriate type of analysis.
	\item To solve a four-bar linkage using the program.
	\item To test different values for Baumgarte stabilization parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
	\item To compare results with an MBD package (e.g.~MSC ADAMS).
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Methods}
A diagram of the system under investigation is presented in Figure~\ref*{fig:system}. Masses of the bodies were determined to be directly proportional to length: $m_1 = m$, $m_2 = 2m$, $m_3 = m \sqrt{2}$.

\end{figure}

To complete task 2, the function \texttt{analyse} was written. This function automatically determines the required type of analysis by checking the system's degrees of freedom and calls the appropriate function. If DOF $=$ 0, the function \texttt{run\_kinematics} is called for kinematic analysis, and if DOF $>$ 0, dynamic analysis is performed using the newly-written function \texttt{run\_dynamics}.


\section*{Results}
The system's dynamic behavior under gravity load was solved within the time span $t = 0 \dots 5$ s with an output step size of $\Delta t = 0.01$ s, using the MATLAB integrated solver \texttt{ode45} with default options. The system's physical parameters were defined as $m = 1$ kg and $L = 1$ m. Several different values for Baumgarte parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ were tested, and a comparison of the resulting values of constraint drift is presented in Figure~\ref*{fig:constraintdrift}. Reference results were computed using MSC ADAMS, employing identical time settings. The difference between these result sets is illustrated in Figure~\ref*{fig:comparison}.


\section*{Analysis}
Examining Figure~\ref*{fig:constraintdrift}, we can see that $\alpha = \beta = 0$ leads to an unacceptable (and continuously growing) amount of drift. The drift is reduced when $\alpha = \beta = 1$, but the maximum value is still high. In general, we can see that greater parameter values lead to smaller amounts of constraint violation, which corresponds to expected behavior.\\

When comparing results computed using the self-written program and ADAMS (Figure~\ref*{fig:comparison}), the behavior is found to be similar. However, the difference in displacement is somewhat significant, with a maximum value of over 2 cm for the investigated body. This divergence occurs even when emplying high values for Baumgarte parameters. Possible causes include:
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
	\item Differences in integrator settings and tolerances.
	\item Differences in the definition of inertia for the rigid bodies.
	\item Differences in formulation of constraints.
\end{itemize}
